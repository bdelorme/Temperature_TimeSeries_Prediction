Hi,

This is a standard requirement for all ML engineering positions.

* Why
We want to know more about you and your:
- problem solving skills
- creativity
- critical thinking
- data science skills
- coding mindset and style

* General guidelines
Imagine you are part of a team and others will be working on this or taking it over and you want to be friends.
Write your project as if it was used by others at the end of this day.

* Languages
The coding challenge should be completed in the programming language of your choice.
You can use 3rd party libs or tools but you should justify their usage.

* Duration
We ask that you return it by email within 2 days from the moment you received it.

* Documentation
Ideally, the code is self-descriptive. If you feel the need to explain implementation choices, or anything else, please insert this as code comments at the most appropriate location.
Project-wide comments, justification, hypothesis or setup instructions can go in a README.

* Description and goal
You are given a data set (attached), provided by RATP (https://data.ratp.fr) under open data Etalab license. The data set contains data coming from a subway station in csv format.

You should implement a system that predicts the temperature of this subway station for the next hour, “h”:
- You can use historical data from the beginning of time to “h”-1 (included)
- You can use other columns of the dataset (CO2, humidity…)
- You should provide your code as a module/library with an API (a well-defined list of functions). This API should be easy to integrate for a developer.
- You should provide a code that can be run in command line, and will use your module to produce the prediction result.
- You can provide experimentation, benchmark or any other code (as a notebook for example).

Please note that the data and information that we have provided to you is considered to be confidential and as such, you may not use or disclose this data and information other than as part of this Coding Challenge. In addition, you may not share or publish (including by posting to a blog, website or otherwise) the report and any code you have prepared as part of the Coding Challenge that contains any of this data and information without Samsung's express, prior written approval.

Thank you for your cooperation and compliance with the above conditions and good luck with the Coding Challenge!

Gilles
